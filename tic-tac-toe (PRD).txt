Tic-Tac-Toe Web Game (Five-Round Version)
________________


1. Overview
This project is a one-page interactive web application that allows users to play a five-round series of tic-tac-toe games against themselves (local two-player). The interface features a soft green background, a centered gray game container, a red game timer at the top, and a classic 3×3 tic-tac-toe grid in the middle. The game displays win/lose/draw messages for each round and automatically resets once five rounds have been completed.
The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, with no external dependencies.
